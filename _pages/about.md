Hi, I'm Matt. I use data science techniques including machine learning and deep learning to solve business challenges. I have 17 years of experience in financial services with domain expertise in digital marketing and performance analytics. You can see some examples of my work on [github](https://github.com/matthewnicoletta). I hold an MBA from Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business and am currently pursuing an MS in Business Analytics also at Georgetown.

Recent accomplishments include:

+ Led a team of 5 analysts to develop KPIs and reporting methodologies using SQL and Tableau. Key dashboards and reports created or enhanced include: loan Time In Process (TIP), auto loan recapture, loyalty program cost analysis, and loan application pull-through rate. 

+ Developed and maintained a successful data-driven, segmented e-mail marketing and social media strategy, employing tactics such as content marketing, drip campaigns, and A/B and MV testing. Sent 6.6 million personalized promotional and informational e-mails in one year, exceeding industry benchmarks by achieving a 31% open rate and 8% response rate.

+ Identified a mortgage product offering gap through competitive market analysis. Developed a pricing methodology for borrower closing cost assistance and supervised product roll out. Saw immediate lift of around 5%.

+ Implemented two integrated event-driven drip marketing campaigns for loan originations using the Intuvo platform, achieving a 46% lift in loan applicant customer engagement in the first 3 months.

“Matt's approach to his work is holistic. While finding the immediate solution to an opportunity, he often finds better ways to get the desired results. His wide-range of skills allows him to do this easily and his expertise is multi-varied.” - Basil Parlett, Head of Business Development @ BFSFCU

I geek out on applying quantitative/data science methodologies to find interesting solutions to business problems, specifically for financial services/FinTech companies. Want to connect? Email me at matthew.nicoletta@gmail.com.
